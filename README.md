# Phase 1

## Week 4
1. Check without unique function
2. Make a loop to check series all the instance pictures (if they are in same sizes)
3. Clean and consistent, if there is missing values
4. Check the images, if its the best image in the series ID
5. Pandas dataframe, drop, fillna, mode, SMOTE



## Week 5 (cuurent week)

1. Document and possibly implement data cleaning process including imputing data for missing data and to balance the dataset.
2. Document the output architecture based upon 5*5=25 sets of 3 severity levels which can then be applied to a softmax layer that processes each of those 3 severity levels as a probability. Document how that will be transformed to a submission file. 
3. Study appropriate loss function for 1 of 3 severity levels and how to combine all 25 of them for a single study 
4. Investigate distribution of number of series per study (1, 2 or 3) and number of instances per series (1 - 15?)
5. Research techniques to handle variable number of inputs (input size) via scholar.google.com, Medium/stackoverflow/TowardsDataScience.com/etc., and other peoplesâ€™ notebooks.
